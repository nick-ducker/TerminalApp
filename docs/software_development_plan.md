## Statement of Purpose and Scope
**Dive Bar** is a Quick Time Action (QTE) game developed using pure Ruby, solely for use in the command line terminal. It is intended to be a tribute to the classic Japanese QTE games in the "Shenmue" adventure series developed by Sega. 

##### Description of Application
The premise of **Dive Bar** is that you're a bartender working by yourself in a busy dive bar. You will need to perform actions in a hectic environment in order for the night to run smoothly. Failure to perform the tasks will result in angry customers and maybe an empty bar!

At it's core, the game is based on a simple time pressure mechanic. The player will be shown a sentence and will have to type the highlighted word in the sentence as fast as possible. If the player enters the word in time, and the word is correct, they will only lose a small amount of points based on the time taken to answer. If the player fails to enter the word in time, they will lose points. If the player enters the word in time but the word is wrong, they will also lose points. 

The twist in this simple mechanic is the way the prompts are displayed to the user. Instead of it simply displaying text and timing the input, **Dive Bar** will throw random snippets of conversation at the user if a confusing manner. Eventually a prompt will be displayed in the same manner, before pausing for user input. A player trying for a high score, or trying to win the game at higher difficulty levels, will have to pay attention to all the snippets until they see the highlighted keyword. 

##### Motivation

**Dive Bar** is not to designed to redefine gaming mechanics or be a "helpful" program, but is instead intended to be a throwback to the aformentioned QTE games developed by Sega. My hope is that anyone who has previously enjoyed the Shenmue series or enjoys time pressure mechanics in their game experience will get a kick out of this simple program. 

The QTE mechanic is classically based around some kind of graphical action sequence wherin the player is periodically prompted for input in order to progress further. This input is usually time sensitive. If the player does not hit the correct button, or takes too long to do so, they are penalized and/or must restart the sequence. 

I did some brainstorming and experimentation with the concept in the week leading up to developing **Dive Bar**. Initially, I wanted to try and create some form of map based "Restaurant Dash" style game, where the player would have to move between tables and a kitchen quickly when prompted. Ultimately I moved away from the idea as it became clear that the scope of the project was too large for the time availabe to develop.

I then started moving toward the concept of a more text based interaction with a similar mechanic based around entering text. While I think creating a map based game would certainly feel more hectic if coupled with text, I'm happy with the way **Dive Bar** turned out. While it is a simple game, I think it provides good challenges and rewards to players who are willing to spend some time trying to maximise their scores or pass one of the higher difficulty levels.

### 23/4/20 Status update
At this stage, almost all of the initial documentation has been written. I tried to be as comprehensive as possible in all aspects of the documentation. The features and implementation plan is written with the intent that it could be given to another coder, and they should be able to create a very similar program. 

Perhaps the only part of the documentation that I feel is lacking is an explicit explanation of the gems used. I'll need to make sure I come back around to this before wrapping up the project in presentation.

The latest development has been finishing up writing my automated unit tests in Ruby and the manual test sheet. Between the unit tests and the manual test sheet, I'm pretty confident that I'll be able to test almost every aspect of the program before I actually put it all together. I'm really interested to see how this affects the experience of writing the code. I keep thinking that I'm spending too much time writing documentation and tests, but I'm hoping this pays off in the long run and makes the game extremely easy to code.

It's definitely an interesting experience to try and design every aspect of every method in your head, explain it and write a test for it, before you start coding it!

The next steps will be to start writing the code to pass the tests. Only once all of the tests are passing, will I start looking at my implementation plan.
